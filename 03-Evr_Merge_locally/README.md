# Merging Into main locally 💻

In this activity, you will practise merging local changes into `main`. This activity must be completed **after** the `pull` activity; it cannot stand alone. 
**⚠️ It is imperative that before doing a merge locally, you do a pull, so you are actually merging on the updated main branch.⚠️**

## Instructions

* After pulling changes from GitHub, each team member should checkout `main`. 🚨`git checkout main`

* Next, each team member should merge the branch that they’ve created and named into `main`. 🚨 `git merge <name>/branching_exercise`

  * After merging, each team member should push their changes to GitHub. 🚨`git push origin`. Try to go one by one.

* 🔑 If Git refuses to `push`, run `git pull`, and try again.

  * Take a moment to discuss why this is necessary.

* Once everyone has pushed their changes to GitHub, each team member should pull the repository. 🚨`git pull`

* After pulling, discuss newly added files with your teammates.

## Hint

* 🤯 A common, extra-safe workflow is to _always_ `git pull` before you `git push` even if you expect that nothing has changed.
